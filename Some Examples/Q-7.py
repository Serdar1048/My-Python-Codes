
#? Q.7: Write a function named merge that i) takes two lists (L1, L2) where the numbers
#? are stored in ascending order, ii) merges them into a list such that the numbers after
#? the merge are also stored in ascending order, and finally iii) returns the list.
#? Note that, as shown in the comments below, the lengths of the input lists can be
#? different and vary.
#? Note also that you do not use any of the built-in sorting functions or methods from
#? Python.

# L2 = [1, 5, 7, 12, 13, 19]
# list to be returned = [1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19]
